## What is this project?
This project is the backend API of TH News, a reddit-style news app that allows users to read, like and comment on articles. 
It is built using Express, and the endpoints and routing allow for the frontend to connect with the database.

## Cloning
1. Navigate to a local directory in your CLI (e.g. Terminal) 
2. Run this command:  `git clone https://github.com/tom-ai/be-nc-news.git`

## Getting Started
Required for the project are **Node.js** and **Postgres**. Make sure you have these installed to a minimum version of
Node.js - `v17.7.2`
Postgres - `14.2`
### Install dependencies
1. Install Node if you havenâ€™t already: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Seed the local database
The database will first need to be seeded with data. To do this, run `npm run seed` in the CLI
### Use different data sets
There are two sets of data included: test and development. In production, the development database is used, and for testing, the test database will be used.
For the necessary databases to be used, create some routing by making the following files in your route directory:
1. A `test.env` file with `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test` inside
2. A `development.env` file with `PGDATABASE=nc_news`
For security, add the filenames to your `.gitignore` file
### Run tests
To run the tests, run `npm test __tests__/app.test.js`
